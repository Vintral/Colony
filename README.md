# Colony Crew

Godot project for building a colony game simulator.

Goal was to procedurally generate a planet and use that as the "game map" to play on and build buildings upon.  And then have actors who will move around/across the surface of this generated world.

## Status
Backburner

Spent a lot of time working out procedurally generating planets to play on and got bogged down in trying to make this work. A lot of progress was made, unfortunately results were not satisfactory.  Playing on procedurally generated planets just couldnt be made to feel "right".  And things just looked off, unless the planet was made large enough to not visually be impactful anymore.  Defeating the goal.  Hopefully this will be revisited someday with some better ideas on how to tackle this, or just give up and have game play be a different more traditional flatter style, and just leverage planets being generated for use in a game screen to select the world/landing zone.

## Requirements
